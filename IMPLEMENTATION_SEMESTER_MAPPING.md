# Implementation Summary: Semester and Course Mapping Extension

## Overview
Successfully extended the Campus Guard university database to support the Department → Year → Semester → Subject hierarchy with automated data generation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes (`009_add_semesters_and_course_mapping.sql`)

#### New Tables Created

**semesters**
- Stores 2 semesters per academic year
- Fields: id, year_id (FK), semester_number, semester_name, created_at, updated_at
- Unique constraint: (year_id, semester_number)
- Ensures only 2 semesters per year

**department_course_map**
- Junction table linking semesters to courses
- Fields: id, semester_id (FK), course_id (FK), created_at, updated_at
- Unique constraint: (semester_id, course_id)
- Prevents duplicate course assignments

#### Automated Data Generation

**Trigger: auto_create_years_for_department()**
- Fires AFTER INSERT on departments table
- Automatically creates 4 years (1st-4th) for each new department
- Uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for idempotency

**Trigger: auto_create_semesters_for_year()**
- Fires AFTER INSERT on years table
- Automatically creates 2 semesters for each new year
- Uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for idempotency

**Data Flow:**
```
New Department → 4 Years → 8 Semesters (2 per year)
```

#### Backfill Operation
- Generates semesters for all existing years in the database
- Ensures consistency for data created before this migration

#### Performance Optimizations
- Index on semesters.year_id for faster joins
- Index on department_course_map.semester_id for faster lookups
- Index on department_course_map.course_id for reverse lookups

#### Security (Row Level Security)
- SELECT policies: Allow all authenticated users to read data
- ALL policies (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE): Restricted to admin role only

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### supabase/README.md
- Added documentation for new tables (semesters, department_course_map)
- Updated migration instructions to include step 20-21
- Added "Automatic Data Generation" section explaining trigger behavior
- Updated sample data section to mention 8 semesters per department

#### docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_HIERARCHY.md
- Created comprehensive visual schema diagram
- Documented entity relationships
- Provided example SQL queries for common operations
- Explained data flow and cascade behavior
- Listed benefits of the design approach

#### supabase/migrations/009_MIGRATION_NOTES.md
- Created testing checklist
- Documented SQL verification queries
- Explained compatibility with existing schema

## Design Decisions

### Simplified Schema
Initially considered including department_id and year_id in department_course_map, but simplified to only include semester_id and course_id because:
- Department and year can be derived through joins (semester → year → department)
- Reduces data redundancy
- Prevents potential inconsistencies
- Maintains referential integrity through foreign keys
- Simpler queries and maintenance

### Centralized Course Pool
- Courses table remains centralized (no duplication)
- Same course can be assigned to multiple semesters/departments
- Update course details once, reflects everywhere
- Follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Automatic Generation
- Removes manual setup burden
- Ensures consistency across all departments
- Follows convention over configuration
- New departments are immediately usable

## Database Hierarchy

```
departments (CSE, ECE, ME, CE, ...)
  └── years (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) [Auto-created]
      └── semesters (Semester 1, Semester 2) [Auto-created]
          └── courses (via department_course_map) [Admin-assigned]
```

## Testing & Verification

### Build Verification
- ✅ npm run lint: Passes (pre-existing warnings remain)
- ✅ npm run build: Completes successfully
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced

### Schema Validation
- ✅ Tables properly reference existing tables
- ✅ Cascading deletes configured
- ✅ Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- ✅ Check constraints enforce valid semester numbers (1 or 2)
- ✅ Indexes created for performance

### Migration Safety
- ✅ Uses IF NOT EXISTS for table creation
- ✅ Uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for data insertion
- ✅ Does not modify existing tables
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data
- ✅ Can be rolled back if needed

## Usage Examples

### Query all semesters for a department
```sql
SELECT d.name, y.year_name, s.semester_name
FROM departments d
JOIN years y ON y.department_id = d.id
JOIN semesters s ON s.year_id = y.id
WHERE d.code = 'CSE'
ORDER BY y.year_number, s.semester_number;
```

### Assign a course to a semester
```sql
INSERT INTO department_course_map (semester_id, course_id)
SELECT s.id, c.id
FROM departments d
JOIN years y ON y.department_id = d.id AND y.year_number = 1
JOIN semesters s ON s.year_id = y.id AND s.semester_number = 1
CROSS JOIN courses c
WHERE d.code = 'CSE' AND c.code = 'CS101';
```

### View complete course assignments
```sql
SELECT 
    d.name AS department,
    y.year_name,
    s.semester_name,
    c.code,
    c.name,
    c.credits
FROM departments d
JOIN years y ON y.department_id = d.id
JOIN semesters s ON s.year_id = y.id
JOIN department_course_map dcm ON dcm.semester_id = s.id
JOIN courses c ON c.id = dcm.course_id
ORDER BY d.name, y.year_number, s.semester_number, c.code;
```

## Benefits

1. **No Duplication**: Course data stored once, used everywhere
2. **Maintainability**: Update course details in one place
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add departments, years, or courses
4. **Automation**: New departments get complete setup automatically
5. **Flexibility**: Same course can be in multiple semesters
6. **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys enforce relationships
7. **Performance**: Indexes optimize common queries
8. **Security**: RLS policies protect data access

## Next Steps for Admins

1. Apply migration 009 to production database
2. Verify existing departments have 8 semesters each
3. Use admin interface to assign courses to semesters
4. Test creating a new department to verify auto-generation
5. Monitor query performance with new indexes

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `supabase/migrations/009_add_semesters_and_course_mapping.sql` - Main migration
- `supabase/migrations/009_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - Testing guide
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_HIERARCHY.md` - Visual documentation

### Modified
- `supabase/README.md` - Updated table documentation

## Compatibility

- ✅ Compatible with Supabase RLS
- ✅ Compatible with existing authentication
- ✅ Compatible with existing tables (departments, years, courses)
- ✅ Compatible with existing admin/student/TA workflows
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the migration can be rolled back:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS department_course_map CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS semesters CASCADE;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_auto_create_semesters ON years;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_auto_create_years ON departments;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auto_create_semesters_for_year();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auto_create_years_for_department();
```

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully extends the university database with:
- ✅ Proper semester management (2 per year, 8 per department)
- ✅ Flexible course-to-semester mapping
- ✅ Automated hierarchy generation
- ✅ Clean relational structure
- ✅ No data redundancy
- ✅ Backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The solution is production-ready and follows PostgreSQL and Supabase best practices.
