# 3D Face Capture Feature

## Overview

The 3D Face Capture feature enhances the biometric attendance system with support for capturing and processing 3D facial data. This provides improved security, anti-spoofing capabilities, and more accurate face recognition.

## Features

### 1. Device Capability Detection
- Automatically detects device capabilities for depth sensing
- Supports WebXR Depth Sensing API (experimental)
- Checks for LiDAR support (iOS devices)
- Checks for ARCore Depth API (Android devices)
- Provides photogrammetry fallback for all devices

### 2. Capture Methods

#### Photogrammetry (Multi-View Capture)
- Available on all devices as a fallback
- Guides users through a 10-second capture process
- Captures 30 frames while user rotates head
- Provides real-time progress feedback
- Suitable for server-side 3D reconstruction

#### WebXR Depth Sensing (Experimental)
- Uses browser WebXR API when available
- Requires supported device and browser
- Currently a stub implementation requiring full WebXR session setup

#### Native Depth (Capacitor Plugin)
- LiDAR support for iOS devices via Capacitor bridge
- ARCore Depth API for Android devices via Capacitor bridge
- Real-time depth capture from native sensors
- High-quality depth data (< 1cm accuracy for LiDAR)

### 3. Biometric Consent Management
- Required consent dialog before 3D capture
- Complies with privacy regulations
- Clear explanation of data usage
- User rights information (access, deletion, withdrawal)
- Consent tracking in database

### 4. Data Storage
- Secure storage in Supabase Storage
- Encrypted at rest
- Private bucket with access controls
- Supports multiple formats:
  - Point clouds (.ply)
  - Depth maps (.png)
  - Mesh files (.glb, .obj)
  - Face embeddings (JSON/base64)

### 5. Enhanced Anti-Spoofing
- Depth-based spoofing detection
- Variance analysis across face region
- Combined with existing 2D heuristics
- Detects flat surfaces (photos, screens)

## Database Schema

### New Fields in `students` Table

```sql
face_mesh_url            TEXT           -- URL to 3D mesh file
face_pointcloud_url      TEXT           -- URL to point cloud file
face_depthmap_url        TEXT           -- URL to depth map image

```

### New Fields in `teaching_assistants` Table
Same fields as students table.

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `detectDeviceCapabilities()`
Detects device capabilities for 3D capture.

```typescript
const capabilities = await detectDeviceCapabilities();
// Returns: DeviceCapabilities object
```

#### `PhotogrammetryCapture.start()`
Starts multi-view capture process.

```typescript
const controller = new PhotogrammetryCapture();
const result = await controller.start(videoElement, onProgress);
// Returns: PhotogrammetryCapture result with frames
```

#### `upload3DFaceData()`
Uploads 3D face data to Supabase Storage.

```typescript
const result = await upload3DFaceData(studentId, capture);
// Returns: UploadResult with URLs
```

#### `updateBiometricConsent()`
Updates student biometric consent status.

```typescript
await updateBiometricConsent(studentId, true);
```

### Data Structures

#### `Face3DCapture`
```typescript
{
  method: CaptureMethod;
  timestamp: Date;
  rgbFrame?: string;
  depthMap?: DepthMapData;
  pointCloud?: PointCloudData;
  mesh?: MeshData;
  embedding?: Float32Array;
  antiSpoofingMetrics: {
    depthScore: number;
    textureScore: number;

```typescript
{
  consent: boolean;
  consentDate: Date;
  purposes: string[];
}
```

## Usage Guide

### Enabling 3D Capture in UI

1. **Check Device Capabilities**
   - Component automatically detects capabilities on mount
   - Shows 3D toggle if supported methods are available

2. **Request User Consent**
   - Toggle triggers consent modal
   - User must accept terms before enabling

3. **Capture Process**
   - For photogrammetry: 3-second countdown, 10-second guided capture
   - User slowly rotates head left and right
   - Real-time progress indicator shows frame count

4. **Data Upload**
   - Frames are processed and uploaded to storage
   - Database is updated with file URLs
   - Face embedding is computed and stored

### Example Integration

```typescript
<FaceRecognition
  mode="capture"
  studentId={currentStudent.id}
  onCapture={async (imageData, antiSpoofing, capture3D) => {
    if (capture3D) {
      // Handle 3D capture data
      const uploadResult = await upload3DFaceData(
        studentId, 
        capture3D
      );
      
      await updateStudent3DFaceData(
        studentId,
        uploadResult,
        embedding,
        'face-api-v1'
      );
    } else {
      // Handle 2D capture as before
      await saveStudentFaceData(studentId, imageData);
    }
  }}
/>
```
