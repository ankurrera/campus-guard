# Campus Guard

A comprehensive attendance management system with support for administrators, faculty, students, and teaching assistants.

## ðŸš¨ Important: Database Setup Required

**Before running the application, you must apply database migrations to avoid the error:**
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "teaching_assistants" does not exist
```

### ðŸš€ Quick Fix

**See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the fastest way to fix this error (2-3 minutes).**

Or run the automated setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup-migrations.sh
./setup-migrations.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check if Supabase CLI is installed
2. Link to your Supabase project
3. Apply all necessary migrations
4. Create the required tables (courses, teaching_assistants, course_assignments)
