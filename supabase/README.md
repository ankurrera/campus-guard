## How to Apply These Changes

### âš¡ Quick Method: Automated Script (Recommended)

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
chmod +x setup-migrations.sh
./setup-migrations.sh
```

This script will guide you through the entire setup process automatically.

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Manual)

1. Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   
   # Linux (manual install)
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/latest/download/supabase_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz
   sudo mv supabase /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Windows
   scoop install supabase
   ```

2. Login to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

3. Link your project:
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref qauglrdqssnesfdacxfk
   ```

4. Apply the migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution via Supabase Dashboard
1. Copy the contents of `001_add_ta_tables.sql`
2. Go to your Supabase dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute the SQL commands
4. Copy the contents of `002_add_ta_insert_policy.sql`
5. Paste and execute the SQL commands in the SQL Editor

## Sample Data

The migration includes sample courses:
- CS101: Computer Science Fundamentals
- CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms
- CS301: Database Systems
- CS250: Web Development

## Security Policies

Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled with these policies:
- Anyone can view courses
- Authenticated users can insert their own TA profile during signup
- TAs can view/update their own profile
- TAs can view their course assignments
- Admin access needs to be configured based on your existing admin setup

## Next Steps

After running the migration:
1. TAs can register using the `/ta/signup` page
2. Admins can assign TAs to courses through the admin dashboard
3. TAs can access their dashboard at `/ta/dashboard`

## TA Workflow

1. **Registration**: TAs sign up with their employee ID and credentials
2. **Course Assignment**: Admins assign TAs to specific courses
3. **Dashboard Access**: TAs can view assigned courses and monitor attendance
4. **Attendance Monitoring**: TAs can track student attendance for their assigned courses
